# Relaybot
This is a multi-server one-way Discord->Northstar relay and stat tracking bot. This bot relies on several custom mods to work.

### TODO:
- [ ] Reimplement whitelist
- [x] Account Linking (needs testing)
- [x] RCON (includes auto banning and the works)
- [ ] Group messages together before sending
- [x] Nearly every command and function needs to include a server identifier
